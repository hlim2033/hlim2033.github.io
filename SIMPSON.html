							<p>One day, I came across dataset from Kaggle that I could not just pass. The Simpsons Characters Image dataset of 20 characters from The Simpsons, the cartoon: <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset">https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset.</a> Looking at the characters, they share a lot of characteristics that are common among them. For example, their skin color is yellow, and look at the eerily similar eyes on the picture above. Then I got to wonder if machine learning could classify the characters of images. Obviously, this is harder question than the well-known cat vs. dog example. I specifically decided to use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this task. Instead of the 20 characters provided, I narrowed it down to 10 characters who are more well-known. Below is the some images used to train the model.

							<p>The architecture of the model constitute a series of convolutional kernels, downsampling, pooling, and a couple of fully connected layers with the last layer of 10 nodes, each node representing a character. The model was trained, validated, and finally tested with unseen images. The model succesfully predicted the characters, which is shown in the below confusion matrix. It is intersting to see that the model sometimes confuse Homer Simpson, Bart Simpson, and Lisa Simpson (no wonder they are familiy). </p>

							<p>So you know that the model can actually classify the characters, some of the layers in the model could be used for dimensionality reduction purpose. The penultimate layer is composed of 50 nodes, so if we plug in an image with 10,000 featurs (100 X 100), you will narrow its features down to 50, and we know that the dimensionality reduction makes sense because the reduced features were used to succesfully classify the characters. Once the features were reduced for images, I applied tSNE to see how the images would look like in a even lower dimension which is shown below. You can see that images of the same character tend to locate close to each other, yet there are some cases where they are mingled. </p>

							<p>It is interesting to notice that Krusty the Clown (brown) are really well sepeated and so are Marge Simpson(red) images. If you know them, they actually do stand out from other characters due to their unique features. Also, see how Milhouse Van Houten is loactaed very close to Marge Simpson. They share a same unique feature: the blue hair!</p>

							<p> After this, I decide to apply Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as an another feature reduction tool, and also to visualize what the model is learning. The general architecture I used is a convolutional variational autoencoder where the bottleneck (the latent layer) contains 200 nodes. Once the Vae was trained and validated, I let images from one character pass the VAE and store each of the image's reduced features, get a mean of the reduced features, and then plug in back to the decoder to see what the model 'learned'. The results are shown below. All of them are obviously show yellow skin as expected, but there are some apparent features you can visually confirm. For example, Lisa's head is more bigger then Bart, and Homer is wearing the famous white t-shirt. For Marge, check out the blue hair!</p>
